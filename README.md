# Setup
Quick description of my Setup

The idea of my Setup is to make myself independent of a working internet connection as much as possible. The next step was the VPS, to separate myself from megacorporations as far as possible (yes, I know this platform is owned by microsoft. Please be patient). So far the newest addition is the "BerryTV" (thats how I call it since it is supposed to rid me of my apple TV). It works wonderfully as a set top box. I overdid it a lot on the ram (8 GB since I wanted to futureproof it with possible games to play over stream or something).

Feel free to contact me on matrix (@haui:matrix.giftedmc.com) or on mastodon (@haui@mastodon.giftedmc.com) if you have further questions or need help with your setup.
